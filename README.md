## Install Instructions:
Copy ExpAdv3 folder into your Gmod addons folder, if you are on a Linux enviroment you will need to rename the folder to expadv3 (lower case) or the addon will not load.

Make sure to remove any old ExpAdv2 or Lemongate addons from Garrysmod before installing, if you have installed these via workshop you will need to delete the workshop file in your addons folder.
